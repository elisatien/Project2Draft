Scientific Question:
What are the differences between the three PPAR subsets and how would that affect what their roles and characteristics are?
Scientific Hypothesis:
If PPAR Alpha differs significantly from PPAR Gamma and PPAR Delta, then that could bring out the area of PPARs that is responsible for facilitating the effects of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated secretion of IL-6.
